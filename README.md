Vehicle Event Logger Design

This project is aimed at designing a **Vehicle Event Logger** system.  
It captures and logs key vehicle events such as ignition status, speed, GPS data, fault codes, and more.

Features
- Logs vehicle data from sensors
- Stores events with timestamps
- Can be analyzed post-accident or for maintenance
- Embedded system based (likely on a microcontroller/BeagleBone/ESP32)

 Folder Structure
- `src/` – Source code
- `docs/` – Diagrams and design documents
- `schematics/` – PCB or wiring designs
- `test/` – Test logs and scripts

Technologies Used
- C / Embedded C
- I2C/SPI/UART interfaces
- Microcontroller or BeagleBone Black
- Optional: CAN Bus, SD Card, RTC

Status
Project is under development. Contributions and suggestions welcome!
